# GIRB.js

Girb.js adds Girb to your website.
Girb is a screenmate application designed for the desktop and brought to the web.

Girb requires jQuery and jQuery UI because Girb has been built with "write less, do more" in mind.

You can easily add Girb to any .html internet page by including the following javascript powers between the < head > < / head > tags:
```javascript
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-3.0.0.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="girb.js"></script>
```
Be sure you recite your incantations correct otherwise the javascript will not include properly.
Javascript is not strongly typed so you have to do this right.
Proper incantations are a critical part of web development.

Finally activate Girb by writing the following powerful javascript code as part of your page's onload event:
```javascript
<body onload="girb();">
```
This executes Girb immediately. After the page has loaded.

Be sure to actually upload the Girb files to your server, in the same directory as the page you wish to Girb, otherwise none of this will work.

Girb was inspired by <a href="http://webneko.net/", target="_blank">WebNeko</a>. A fine relic from a more civilized internet age.
Consider using that instead.
